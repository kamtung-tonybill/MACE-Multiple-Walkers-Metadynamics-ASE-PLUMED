# Multiple Walkers Metadynamics Simulations with a Reactive Machine Learning Interatomic Potential

Reactive machine learning interatomic potential has been of great interest to the computational chemistry community as it can provide atomistic insights to a system of interest with first-principles accuracy
and empirical force fields.
